Week1
This project aims to analyze country-specific data and develop predictive models to estimate CO2 emissions.The dataset comprises data from 1990 to 2011, covering countries worldwide. It includes a wide variety of features such as population statistics, economic indicators, land use, energy consumption, and more.

Week2
The objective was to transform a raw dataset into a clean, structured format suitable for modeling and statistical analysis. Below are the key technical steps performed:
Data Filtering & Row Elimination: Rows containing metadata markers (e.g., "Text" in SCALE or Decimals) were removed to retain only relevant, quantifiable observations.
Feature Selection: Non-informative columns such as "Country name", "Series code", "SCALE", and "Decimals" were dropped to reduce dimensionality and enhance processing efficiency.
Missing Value Treatment: Placeholder strings like ".." and empty cells were converted to NaN, enabling easier detection and later imputation or exclusion, as required.
Data Type Standardization: All columns were coerced into appropriate numerical data types, ensuring compatibility with statistical methods and machine learning models.

This preprocessing pipeline ensures the dataset meets the requirements for robust modeling, reduces noise, and minimizes data leakage risks. With this solid data foundation, the next phase will involve feature engineering, correlation analysis, and model training for predictiveÂ analytics.
